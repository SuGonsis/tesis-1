\vfill
\lettrine{T}{he} term Evolutionary Algorithm is used to describe a computer-based problem solving system that use computational models whose design is inspired by evolution mechanisms. They are based in a \textsc{population} of \textsc{individuals}, where the natural selection, caused by the environmental pressure, leads to an increase of the \textsc{fitness} of the individuals \cite{eiben2010whatis}. This fitness is a evaluation function that describes the quality of the solution of the problem to solve. Individuals of the population are combined and modified by means of \textsc{recombination} and \textsc{mutation} operators, creating new individuals to be added to the population. The general scheme of an EA is described in Figure \ref{fig:basicscheme}.

According to \cite{eiben2010whatis} the features of an EA are:
\begin{itemize}
\item EAs are population based.
\item EAs mostly uses recombination to generate new individual from the existent ones.
\item EAs are stochastic.
\end{itemize}

%During the execution of the EAs, two different phases exist:
%\begin{description}
%\item[Exploration] Generation of new individuals to expand the search space. This is usually performed in the first iterations of the EA.
%\item[Explotation] Concentration in the neighbourhood of the best solutions.
%\end{description}

This chapter introduces a general overview of the most used types of Evolutionary Algorithms to clarify the common elements which compose them. Also, the most extended models to parallelize EAs are presented, to understand all the possible architectural possibilities. Finally, some of the most used frameworks to develop EAs are listed and analysed, to summarize their capabilities and lacks. This way, in following chapters, the design of services for EAs will have a solid base to start.

\section{Types of Evolutionary Algorithms}

\lettrine{A}{lthough} the EAs follows the previous scheme showed in Figure \ref{fig:basicscheme}, they have differences depending of the representation of the solutions, the problems to solve, and other features. This section explains the traditional variants, according to the book of \person{Eiben and Smith} \cite{eiben2003introduction}.

\begin{description}
\item [Genetic Algorithms] These kind of algorithms were proposed by \person{Holland} \citep{holland1975adaptation}, and also studied by \person{Goldberg} \cite{goldberg1988genetic} and \person{Michalewicz} \cite{michalewicz1996genetic}. In this kind of EA, the representation of the solution is a string of numbers (usually binary), called \textsc{chromosome}. The individuals are selected proportionally to their fitness, then \textsc{recombination} and/or \textsc{mutation} are applied to generate new individuals that will be introduced in the population. These algorithms have been used in different areas, such as function optimization \cite{michalewicz1996genetic}, combinatory optimization \cite{Esparcia2009EVITA}, artificial intelligence in videogames \cite{Fernandez20111optimizing}, or generative art \cite{Garcia2013RGB}, among others. 

\item[Evolution Strategies] The Evolution Strategies (ES) are used to solve problems whose solution is included in the domain of real numbers. The main difference with the GAs is the inclusion of self-adaptation of the mutation rate, being coded in each individual \cite{eiben2005shared}. Also, the parent selection is performed randomly. ES have been applied in fields such as Evolutionary Robotics \cite{Garcia2012testing}.

\item[Evolutionary Programming] In Evolutionary Programming (EP), the representation of the solution depends of the nature of the problem to solve, for example, use neuronal networks as individuals \cite{Castillo1999gprop}.

\item[Genetic Programming] The objective of this technique is to create functions or programs to solve determined problems. Individual representation is usually in form of a tree, formed by operators (or {\em primitives}) and variables ({\em terminals}). These sets are usually fixed and known. The genome size is, therefore, variable, but the maximum size of the individuals is usually fixed, to avoid high evaluation costs. GP has been used to evolve \definicion{LISP}{LISt Processing} programs \cite{Koza1990Tools}, or \definicion{XSLT}{eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations} scripts \cite{Garcia2008XSLT}, among others.

\end{description}

Other EAs have been proposed, such as \textsc{Differential Evolution} (DE) \cite{storn1997differential}, \textsc{Estimation of Distribution Algorithms} (EDAs) \cite{larranaga2002estimation} or \textsc{Bayesian Optimization Algorithms} \cite{pelikan2005bayesian}. %SEGURO QUE SON EAS?


%\subsection{Differential Evolution}
%Differential Evolution \cite{} also exploits a population of potential solutions. Three individuals are selected randomly from the population to create \textsc{random noisy vectors}. These vectors are recombined with original random individuals to create the \textsc{trial vectors}. These vectors are compared one by one with the original vector and the better of each comparison is kept for the next generation.

%Table \ref{tab:summaryEAs} shows the main differences between all this types of EAs. Note that we have selected the common features of each algorithm. For example, the replacement in GAs can be different from the generational one, or the representation can also be a real-value vector.

Combining elements of previous algorithms with other heuristics are the base of the \textsc{Memetic Algorithms} (MAs). These algorithms are based in the concept of \textsc{meme} proposed by \person{Dawkins} \cite{dawkins2006selfish}. A meme is domain specific knowledge coded in a computational representation to effective solving a problem. %It is a cultural know-how building-block transmittable and replicable.

This kind of algorithms can be seen as an hybrid combination of the population-based evolution methods previously explained, coupled with some kind of local search. Initially, the hybridization was made just combining two o more methods with some kind of problem knowledge. For example combining a genetic algorithm with Simulated Annealing \cite{Rodriguez2012Hybrid}. The local search can performed before, during, or after the evaluation. New trends, such as adaptative MAs \cite{ong2006classification} leads to the usage of several memes for search and decide dynamically which meme to apply to each individual. For example, \person{Cowling \etal} proposed the term \textsc{hyperheuristic} \cite{cowling2001hyperheuristic} as the strategy to choose a meme to apply depending the time and the region of the search space (or, in a brief, heuristic to choose memes). \person{Krasnogor \etal} \cite{krasnogor2002multimeme} applied the 
inclusion of the memetic codification inside the individual chromosome (\textsc{Multimemes}) to select which meme to use,  or codify a set of rules, as proposed by \person{Smit} \cite{smith2002co} (\textsc{Co-evolving MAs}). 


\section{Parallel and Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms models}

\lettrine{E}{volutionary} Algorithms are inherently parallelizable. Fitness evaluation can be distributed into several slave machines, or distribute the population in different nodes to be evolved at the same time. In 2002, two main types of parallelization models for EAs were classified by \person{Alba and Tomassini} in \cite{alba2002parallelism}: \textsc{Global parallel EAs} and \textsc{Spatially structured EAs}. However, with the aim of new technologies and architectures, such as P2P, new ways for parallelize EAs have been proposed.

\subsection{Traditional parallelization classification}

In this classification, issues such as fault-tolerance, churn, massive scalability or decentralization are not taking into account. The number of computational nodes are fixed during all the execution and both the network and the nodes are reliable and trustworthy.

\subsubsection{Global parallel evolutionary algorithms}
In this model, also called \textsc{Farming model} or \textsc{Centralized EAs}, the parallelism is applied at evaluation level, where a central node coordinate several slave nodes. The central node executes the EA in a sequential way, but distributes the individuals of the population to the slaves just for being evaluated. Figure \ref{fig:masterslave} depicts this situation.%An example can be seen in \cite{NUCLEAR}, where slave nodes evaluates fitness function for simullation of nuclear devices.

\begin{SCfigure}[20][htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{gfx/masterslave.jpg}
\caption{Master-slave model.}
\label{fig:masterslave}
\end{SCfigure}

\subsubsection{Spatially structured algorithms}
The parallelism is performed at population level, that is, dividing the population among the different computing elements.
\begin{description}
\item[Coarse-grained approach] One of the most usual approaches is the \textsc{Island model}, where a number of nodes executes simultaneously the EA, working with different sub-populations at the same time. Each certain number of generations is interchanged (migrated) between populations. Figure \ref{fig:ring} shows this model with a ring topology.

\begin{SCfigure}[20][htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=20pc]{gfx/ring.jpg}
\caption{Island model scheme using a neighbourhood ring topology.}
\label{fig:ring}
\end{SCfigure}

\item[Fine-grained approach] In this approach, also called Cellular EAs (CEAs), each node has one individual of the population, and selection and reproduction is limited with the individuals of the neighbourhood of the node \cite{CELLULAR}. Usually a bi-dimensional grid is used for topology, such as the one showed in the Figure \ref{fig:cellular}.

\begin{SCfigure}[20][htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{gfx/cellular.jpg}
\caption{Cellular Evolutionary Algorithm.}
\label{fig:cellular}
\end{SCfigure}

\end{description}

\subsection{Non-conventional approaches}
Aside from the previous classification, with the aim of new technologies, such as \textsc{cloud computing}, \definicion{P2P}{Peer-to-peer} networks, or the usage of heterogeneous hardware, new approaches have been proposed. Distributed EAs can be executed in other computing elements different than the classic ones. For example, in mobile devices \cite{Garcia2009Mobile}, ``smart dust'' \cite{Rollings2008smartdust} or inside robots, who on-line learn from the environment \cite{Garcia2012testing}. But with the advancement of the Internet, where hundreds of nodes can co-operate, and whose behaviour is not totally controlled or predicted, is when new distributed approaches have become more evident. 

\subsubsection{P2P evolutionary algorithms}

P2P systems are parallel infrastructures composed by a large number of resources, without any central server \cite{steinmetz2005peer}. The resources in this networks can appear or disappear dynamically. This platforms can be used to execute large instances of problems, taking advantage of the massive scalability that these systems offer. \definicion{EvAg}{Evolvable Agent} \cite{laredo2010evag} is an EA who uses a decentralized population, where every peer has a single individual, and new individuals are created combining the ones in their current neighbors. The population structure is maintained using the \textsc{newcast} protocol \cite{jelasity2003newscast}: each node has a cache of neighbours that can be interchanged and combined. Figure \ref{fig:evag} shows this algorithm and population structure. Results show that this algorithm outperforms tuned GAs, using less links that a panmictic population. 

\begin{SCfigure}[20][htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=26pc]{gfx/evag.jpg}
\caption{P2P Evolutionary Algorithm: EvAg.}
\label{fig:evag}
\end{SCfigure}

\subsubsection{Pool-based algorithms}
Other technologies leads to \textsc{Pool-based EAs}, where computational nodes exchange individuals using a shared pool. This allows massive scalability with a heterogeneous underlying structure. This pool can be the global population, and the nodes asynchronously reads and evaluate the individuals, or each node behaves as an island and uses the pool to share individuals. This can lead to automatic load-balancing and synchronization, allowing the addition and removing of computers. Different technologies can be used, for example, in the work of \person{Meri \etal},  where the pool used is based in the Dropbox\texttrademark or SugarSync\texttrademark file storage services. Other authors propose the use of non-relational databases, such as the work of Merelo \etal \cite{merelo2010fluid}, using FluidDB.

In \cite{merelo2012pool} the same authors improve the design, proposing an asynchronous, fault-tolerant, and scalable dEA, based on the object store CouchDB. The results show that adding clients could not scaly, but increase the fault tolerance. Also, their experimentation shows a good methodology for designing EAs in heterogeneous distributed systems, which have the impossibility of analytic performance prediction.

\subsubsection{Grid and volunteer computing}
Grids are distributed computing systems that allow sharing not geographically centered resources to solve large scale problems. \textsc{Volunteer computing} \cite{anderson2005high} proposes the creation of infrastructures to allow people donate CPU cycles for a combined computational effort. The main difference with grid computing are the un-trusted resources: some nodes could return intentionally wrong results, so it requires possibility of replication. Also, the control of the participating nodes is not maintained by the experiment launcher. EAs have been used in this systems, using different techniques, such as virtualization \cite{Fernandez2013BOINC} or ``parasite'' computing \cite{Merelo2007browser}.





\section{Frameworks for Evolutionary Algorithms}
There exist a large number of framework for Evolutionary Algorithms available for download. Practically every programming language has his own implementation of the basic elements that form an EA. This implies a large effort made in each one, because these elements are not compatible among them. It is also difficult to migrate the code from a framework to another, because the existence is hidden global variables or language specific features (such as functional programming \cite{Cruz2013Erlang}). Even as SOA is used extensively in software development, it is not widely accepted in the main EA software.

 

\subsection{Object Oriented Frameworks}
Firstly, there exist
Object Oriented frameworks, such as Al\-go\-rithm::Evo\-lu\-tionary \cite{PERL}, \definicion{METCO}{Metaheuristic-based Extensible Tool for Collaborative Optimization} \cite{Leon2009metco},
\definicion{JCLEC}{Java Class Library for Evolutionary Computation} \cite{JCLEC} or jMetal \cite{JMETAL}. 
 Users implement specific interfaces of these frameworks (such as {\em
   individual} or {\em crossover}) and they group them in the source
 code. For example, creating an operator object that groups several
 operators. However, these frameworks are not compatible among them.
 For example, the operators created in JCLEC can not be used in jMetal
 (despite both are programmed in Java). Also, they can not control the
 services (operators) outside the source code.

\subsection{Parallel frameworks} 
Parallelism and distribution are possible in other frameworks, such as
MALLBA \citep{MALLBA}, \definicion{DREAM}{Distributed Resource Evolutionary Algorithm Machine} \citep{DREAM} or \definicion{ECJ}{Evolutionary Computation in Java} \citep{ECJ}, but
using external libraries (such as \definicion{MPI}{Message Passing Interface} or \definicion{DRM}{Distributed Resource Machine}), so the code that uses these
libraries is mixed with the algoritmh's code.


 Even being distributed, these frameworks can not communicate with each other. HeuristicLab \citep{HEURISTICLAB} is one of the few plug-in and service oriented frameworks. It uses web services for communication, but just to distribute the load, after consulting a central database of available jobs. Finally, the only service oriented optimization framework is gridUFO \citep{gridUFO}, but it only allows the modification of the objective function and the addition of whole algorithms, without combining existing services.  Table \ref{tab:frameworks} shows a summary of the previous frameworks.

\label{tab:frameworks}
\end{SCtable}

In brief, although these frameworks follows the six criteria for genericity 
proposed in \cite{GENERICITY05}, they present some shortcomings when it is needed to develop
or add new features: the user is forced to modify the source code
or stop the execution to add new functionalities (like load balancing,
dynamic control of operators, or an user interface). The authors should
improve their frameworks adding SOA technologies in order to facilitate the
communication and integration among them. As \person{Parejo \etal}  suggest
 in \cite{SURVEYMOFS}, a standardization of the presented (and other) frameworks should be carried out.


\subsection{Grid and volunteer computing frameworks}

Web services have been used in the grid area for optimization problems, as can be seen in the works of \cite{grid1,grid2,grid3,grid5}, where services are defined using WSDL interfaces and other transmission mechanisms (such as Remote Procedure Call \citep{grid6,grid7}). Although there also exist EAs to be executed in grids \citep{grid8,grid4,grid10}) no information about how to design these services for EAs has been provided in previous works.

\definicion{BOINC}{Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing} is one of the most used frameworks in volunteer computing. This middleware follows a master-slave architecture, where the server is in charge of hosting the project experiments and creation and distribution of jobs \cite{Fernandez2013BOINC}. Clients asks to the server for works, download information, compute the data and upload the results. EAs have been used in BOINC, such as the work of \person{Fern\'andez \etal} \cite{Fernandez2013BOINC}. Other authors imitate this architecture using a browser-based scheme \cite{Merelo2007browser} to distribute fitness evaluations among clients without install any other software.

Previous systems have the possibility of task distribution among the nodes, following a master-slave model, but without interaction between clients.

Although all the approaches described in previous sub-sections are focused on the implementation of distributed EAs, the abstraction level of each alternative can be quite different, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:soagrid}. This figure has been updated from the one presented in \cite{SOALIB}. As SOA is a methodology and not a technology, areas such as Evolutionary Robotics, or EA classic frameworks (for example, OSGiLiath) can use SOA to be designed and developed. Implementation technologies, such as Web Services are the gap between SOA (abstract) and grid (infrastructure) where interfaces are designed using SOA principles (dynamism, visibility, loose-coupling and heterogeneity). Finally, cloud computing can be seen as a combination that extends SOA adding the scalability of grid, ad sugested by \person{Jamil} \citep{SOALIB}.

\section {Conclusions}
\lettrine{E}{volutionary} Algorithms, and their subtypes (GAs, ES or GP, among others) follow a number of common steps: initialization, evaluation, selection, recombination, mutation, replacement and stop criterion. There exist many variations of these steps, and the different combinations can specify one algorithm or another. These elements are candidate to be designed as services, as they can behave as input/output functions. Memetic Algorithms also include extra elements that can be applied, and different heuristic can be combined during the algorithm's run.

Distributed EAs can improve the algorithmic and computational performance. Classic parallelization approaches, such as the master-slave or island-based models, have been updated with the usage of new trends as P2P or pool-based EAs. These new approachs manage with computational nodes entering and exiting during the experiment runtime or heterogeneous architectures.

Finally, there exist a large number of different (and incompatible) frameworks for EAs, each one using different languages, technologies and communication protocols. 

All these facts have motivated us to create a proper way to define services for evolutionary algorithms.
\begin{itemize}
\item Services can be combined in different ways to create the different types of EAs. The services must be designed taking into account the elements that form an EA. 
\item Services are independent of the used technology or the communication protocol. For example, a fitness service can be distributed or local.
\item Services are not aware of the order of execution, so this paradigm can fit with new parallel approaches for EAs, where nodes control is not centralized. 
\item Existent EA frameworks could also be adapted to be accessed as services.
\end{itemize}

Next chapters will explain the chosen design principles for developing services for EAs.

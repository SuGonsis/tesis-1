	the dilemma of either causing lots of false alarms or missing considerable
	parts of nonstationary areas. This contribution presents a way out
	of this dilemma by viewing change detection as an inverse, ill--posed
	problem. As such, the problem can be solved using prior knowledge
	about typical properties of change masks. This reasoning leads to
	a Bayesian formulation of change detection, where the prior knowledge
	is brought to bear by appropriately specified a priori probabilities.
	Based on this approach, a new, adaptive algorithm for change detection
	with drastically improved performance is derived. The algorithm requires
	only a single raster scan per picture, thus increasing the computational
	load only slightly in comparison to conventional nonadaptive techniques.},

  month = mar,
  abstract = {1. A suction electrode was used to record the membrane current of
	single rod outer segments in pieces of toad retina. During dim illumination
	the membrane current showed pronounced fluctuations. 2. Amplitude
	histograms of responses to dim flashes of fixed intensity exhibited
	two discrete peaks, one at 0 pA and one near 1 pA, suggesting that
	the response was quantized. By setting a criterion amplitude level,
	flash responses could be classed as 'failures' (no response) or as
	'successes' (at least one quantal event). 3. The variation of fraction
	of successes with flash intensity was consistent with the hypothesis
	that each quantal electrical event resulted from a single photoisomerization.
	4. The quantal event had a mean amplitude of about 1 pA (5% of the
	standing dark current) and a standard deviation of 0.2 pA. Dispersion
	in the event amplitude prevented identification of histogram peaks
	corresponding to two or more photoisomerizations. 5. Individual quantal
	responses exhibited a smooth shape very similar to that of the average
	quantal response. This suggests that a single photoisomerization
	releases many particles of transmitter and that radial diffusion
	of internal transmitter is not a major source of delay in the light
	response. 6. The 'quantum efficiency' with which an absorbed photon
	generated an electrical event was measured as 0.5 +/- 0.1 (S.E. of
	mean, n = 4). This is slightly lower than the quantum efficiency
	of photoisomerization obtained previously for rhodopsin in solution.
	7. At wavelengths between 420 and 700 nm the quantal event was invariant
	in size, although the cell's sensitivity varied over a range of 10(5).
	8. The power spectrum of the fluctuations in dim steady light was
	predicted by assuming that a random series of quantal events occurred
	independently. 9. In brighter light the fluctuations were faster,
	and the response to an incremental flash was reduced in size and
	duration. The power spectrum could be predicted by assuming random
	superposition of events with the shape of the incremental flash response.},

  abstract = {1. Visual transduction in rods of the cynomolgus monkey, Macaca fascicularis,
	was studied by recording membrane current from single outer segments
	projecting from
	
	small pieces of retina. 
	
	2. Light flashes evoked transient outward-going photocurrents with
	saturating amplitudes of up to 34 pA. A flash causing twenty to fifty
	photoisomerizations gave a response of half the saturating amplitude.
	The response-stimulus relation was of the form 1-e-x where x is flash
	strength.
	
	3. The response to a dim flash usually had a time to peak of 150-250
	ms and resembled the impulse response of a series of six low-pass
	filters.
	
	4. From the average spectral sensitivity of ten rods the rhodopsin
	was estimated to have a peak absorption near 491 nm.
	
	5. The spectral sensitivity of the rods was in good agreement with
	the average human scotopic visibility curve determined by Crawford
	(1949), when the human curve was corrected for lens absorption and
	self-screening of rhodopsin.
	
	6. Fluctuations in the photocurrent evoked by dim lights were consistent
	with a quantal event about 0-7 pA in peak amplitude.
	
	7. A steady light causing about 100 photoisomerizations s-1 reduced
	the flash sensitivity to half the dark-adapted value. At higher background
	levels the rod rapidly saturated. These results support the idea
	that dim background light desensitizes human scotopic vision by a
	mechanism central to the rod outer segments while scotopic saturation
	may occur within the outer segments. 
	
	8. Recovery of the photocurrent after bright flashes was marked by
	quantized step-like events. The events had the properties expected
	if bleached rhodopsin in the disks occasionally caused an abrupt
	blockage of the dark current over about one-twentieth of the length
	of the outer segment. It is suggested that superposition of these
	events after bleaching may contribute to the threshold elevation
	measured psychophysically.
	
	9. The current in darkness showed random fluctuations which disappeared
	in bright light. The continuous component of the noise had a variance
	of about 0-03 pA2 and a power spectrum that fell to half near 3 Hz.
	A second component, consisting of discrete events resembling single-photon
	responses, was estimated to occur at a rate of 0-006 s-1. It is suggested
	that the continuous component of the noise may be removed from scotopic
	vision by a thresholding operation near the rod output.},

	there is no visible motion blur. Appearance of motion blur is a strong
	perceptual cue, which is automatically present in live--action films,

	we present an approach for automatically simulating motion blur.
	Ours is wholly a post-process, and uses image sequences, both stop
	motion or raw video, as input. First we track the frame--to--frame
	motion of the objects within the image plane. We then integrate the
	scene's appearance as it changed over a period of time. This period
	of time corresponds to shutter speed in live-action filming, and
	gives us interactive control over the extent of the induced blur.
	We demonstrate a simple implementation of our approach as it applies
	to footage of different motions and to scenes of varying complexity.
	Our photorealistic renderings of these input sequences approximate
	the effect of capturing moving objects on film that is exposed for

	that it is consistent with the multiplicative transmittance and reflectance

  abstract = {The thesis investigates the detection of changes between images for
	the low-level part of automated video--surveillance. Change detection
	for video--surveillance comprises the detection of moving objects
	in a scene. The change detector should be illumination--invariant
	as well as noise--robust, and should work in real--time. Thus, to
	detect and examine changes between two gray--value images, we model
	the reference and the current image as vector ensembles, where the
	vector components correspond to pixels. The main assumption of this
	thesis is that, regardless of illumination in the current image,
	pairs of reference and current vectors are linearly dependent. However,
	if an object in the current image changes, then these pairs are linearly
	independent. Linear algebra provides different theorems to determine
	when vectors are linearly dependent. We use these to develop algorithms
	for detecting object changes in the current image. This application
	of linear independence is an innovation. The proposed methods were
	successfully tested on an extensive surveillance image database.
	The results show that our algorithms detect object changes while
	remaining illumination--invariant. These new methods compare favorably
	with competing change detection methods, including the Shading Model,
	the Statistical Change Detection and the Derivative Model. A new
	adaptive threshold further improves object detection and noise suppression.
	We also analyze the numbers of arithmetic operations and memory accesses
	(computational costs) for the new change detection algorithms, using
	a hypothetical computer model. The execution times suggest that our
	algorithms are real--time implementable. Finally, we extend the concept
	of linear independence to detecting changes between multiple images
	and between multispectral images. These extensions are also innovations
	for image change detection. Future applications could include fast
	image segmentation, image database searches and missing data replacement
	in old video sequences.},

	on this model, linear independence is used to describe an operator

  volume = {24},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match
	two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from
	different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large
	systems which evaluate images require the registration of images,
	or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific
	examples of systems where image registration is a significant component
	include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target
	recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images,
	matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation,
	and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.
	Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for
	various types of data and problems. These techniques have been independently
	studied for several different applications, resulting in a large
	body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing
	the relationship between the variations in the images and the type
	of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied.
	Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type
	are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause
	the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation
	is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations
	which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined
	by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation
	class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken.
	The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences
	in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and
	atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values,
	but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The
	third type of variations are differences in the images that are of
	interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes.
	Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed
	by registration, but they make registration more difficult since
	an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical
	that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about
	the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of
	feature space, similarity measure, search space, and search strategy
	which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques
	can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework
	is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between
	the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the
	selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

  abstract = {A new method for evaluating edge detection algorithms is presented
	and applied to measure the relative performance of algorithms by
	Canny, Nalwa--Binford, Iverson--Zucker, Bergholm, and Rothwell. The
	basic measure of performance is a visual rating score which indicates
	the perceived quality of the edges for identifying an object. The
	process of evaluating edge detection algorithms with this performance
	measure requires the collection of a set of gray--scale images, optimizing
	the input parameters for each algorithm, conducting visual evaluation
	experiments and applying statistical analysis methods. The novel
	aspect of this work is the use of a visual task and real images of
	complex scenes in evaluating edge detectors. The method is appealing
	because, by definition, the results agree with visual evaluations
	of the edge images.},

	due to the limited number of electrodes. Various methods such as
	edge detection, contrast enhancement have been studied as the solutions
	of the low resolution problem and these methods have been performed
	to face or object recognition in the close-up image. In this paper,
	we proposed the region-of-interest detection method using a context-based
	model, which is appropriate for real situations. The visually-salient
	region was detected by combining the saliency map with color information.
	In experiment, to evaluate the proposed model, gaze was estimated
	using an eye tracker when subjects watch the original image and two
	types of 10 × 10 pixelized images produced by conventional and saliency
	based method, respectively. Each gaze of pixelized images was compared
	with the gaze of the original image. The experiment showed that the
	gaze using the proposed context based model much more correlates
	with the gaze of the original image than that of conventional model.},

  abstract = {With increased emphasis on functional outcomes in ophthalmology, third--party
	health care payers and research funding agencies have turned their
	attention to the development and use of visual
	
	function questionnaires. Since 1980, more than a dozen such self-report
	visual function questionnaires have been developed. All of these
	instruments include items that ask about specific daily activities;
	
	patients must respond with a rating that represents the level of difficulty
	that they experience with the activity described. This article reviews
	all of the known instruments, with special attention paid to their
	
	validity and reliability. Most validation studies have reported high
	response consistency across items and significant correlations of
	instrument scores with visual impairment measures. Only two studies
	
	have measured test--retest reliability. The developers of visual function
	questionnaires typically divide the items into several different
	subscales, suggesting that different variables are being measured.
	
	Although the items are very similar for the different instruments,
	there is little agreement among instruments on the definition of
	subscales. All instruments are scored as the average of the ordinal
	
	patient ratings across items for each subscale and/or for the total
	instrument. Measurement issues underlying the scoring of ordinal
	patient ratings are discussed. It is argued that unless the instruments
	
	can be converted to interval scales, the averaging of patient ratings
	does not yield true measurements. The three visual function questionnaires
	that were calibrated with a statistical item response model, which
	
	estimates interval scales, are reviewed. It is concluded that future
	research and development should devote additional attention to the
	measurement properties of functional assessment instruments.},

	still image segmentation evaluation, where both the estimated

	not only the accuracy of the boundary localization of the created

	which can hinder the performance of any segmentation algorithm and
	decrease the usability of the segmentation results in

	(1) Security systems act locally and do not cooperate in an effective
	manner, (2) Very valuable assets are protected inadequately by antiquated
	technology systems and (3) Security systems rely on intensive human
	concentration to detect and assess threats.
	
	In this paper we present DETER (Detection of Events for Threat Evaluation
	and Recognition), a research and development (R&D) project aimed
	to develop a high-end automated security system. DETER can be seen
	as an attempt to bridge the gap between current systems reporting
	isolated events and an automated cooperating network capable of inferring
	and reporting threats, a function currently being performed by humans.
	
	The prototype DETER system is installed at the parking lot of Honeywell
	Laboratories (HL) in Minneapolis. The computer vision module of DETER
	reliably tracks pedestrians and vehicles and reports their annotated
	trajectories to the threat assessment module for evaluation. DETER
	features a systematic optical and system design that sets it apart
	from ldquotoyrdquo surveillance systems. It employs a powerful Normal
	mixture model at the pixel level supported by an expectation-maximization
	(EM) initialization, the Jeffreys divergence measure, and the method
	of moments. It also features a practical and accurate multicamera
	calibration method. The threat assessment module utilizes the computer
	vision information and can provide alerts for behaviors as complicated
	as the ldquohoppingrdquo of potential vehicle thieves from vehicle
	spot to vehicle spot.
	
	Extensive experimental results measured during actual field operations
	support DETERrsquos exceptional characteristics. DETER has recently
	been successfully productized. The product-grade version of DETER
	monitors movements across the length of a new oil pipeline.},

  abstract = {This article presents a comparative study of the multiplicative homomorphic
	image processing (MHIP), the log-ratio image processing (LRIP) and
	the logarithmic image processing (LIP). These three image processing
	approaches are based on abstract linear mathematics and provide specific
	operations and structures that have opened up new pathways to the
	development of image processing techniques. The MHIP approach was
	designed for the processing of multiplied images, the LRIP approach
	was introduced to overcome the out-of-range problem associated with
	many image processing techniques, while the LIP approach was developed
	for the processing of images valued in a bounded intensity range.
	First, it is claimed that an image processing framework must be physically
	relevant, mathematically consistent, computationally tractable and
	practically fruitful. It is also pointed out that the classical linear
	image processing (CLIP) is not adapted to non-linear and/or bounded
	range images or imaging systems, such as transmitted light images,
	practical digital images or the human brightness perception system.
	Then, the importance and usefulness of several mathematical fields,
	such as abstract linear algebra and abstract analysis, for image
	representation and processing within such image settings are discussed.
	Third, the MHIP, LRIP and LIP approaches are presented, focusing
	on their distinctive ideas, structures and properties for image representation
	and processing, rather than an in-depth review. Next, a study of
	the relationships and differences between their image representations
	and basic algebraic operations is detailed. Finally, a general comparative
	discussion is developed, showing the main physical, mathematical,
	computational and practical characteristics of these three abstract-linear-mathematics-based
	image processing approaches, and summarizing their respective advantages
	and disadvantages. It is concluded and highlighted through real application
	examples in both image enhancement and edge detection areas that
	the LIP approach surpasses the two other approaches, although, from
	a strictly practical point of view, a detailed quantitative comparative
	study on real applications is now necessary.},

  abstract = {The logarithmic image processing (LIP) model is a mathematical framework
	based on abstract linear mathematics which provides a set of specific
	algebraic and functional operations that can be applied to the processing
	of intensity images valued in a bounded range. The LIP model has
	been proved to be physically justified in the setting of transmitted
	light and to be consistent with several laws and characteristics
	of the human visual system. Successful application examples have
	also been reported in several image processing areas, e.g., image
	enhancement, image restoration, three-dimensional image reconstruction,
	edge detection and image segmentation. The aim of this article is
	to show that the LIP model is a tractable mathematical framework
	for image processing which is consistent with several laws and characteristics
	of human brightness perception. This is a survey article in the sense
	that it presents (almost) previously published results in a revised,
	refined and self-contained form. First, an introduction to the LIP
	model is exposed. Emphasis will be especially placed on the initial
	motivation and goal, and on the scope of the model. Then, an introductory
	summary of mathematical fundamentals of the LIP model is detailed.
	Next, the article aims at surveying the connections of the LIP model
	with several laws and characteristics of human brightness perception,
	namely the brightness scale inversion, saturation characteristic,
	Webers and Fechners laws, and the psychophysical contrast notion.
	Finally, it is shown that the LIP model is a powerful and tractable
	framework for handling the contrast notion. This is done through
	a survey of several LIP-model-based contrast estimators associated
	with special subparts (point, pair of points, boundary, region) of
	intensity images, that are justified both from a physical and mathematical
	point of view.},

  abstract = {Numerous theories of neural processing, often motivated byexperimental
	observations, have explored the computational properties of neural
	codes based on the absolute or relative timing of spikes in spike
	trains. Spiking neuron models and theories however, as well as their
	experimental counterparts, have generallybeen limited to the simulation
	or observation of isolated neurons, isolated spike trains, or reduced
	neural populations. Such theories would therefore seem inappropriate
	to capture the properties of a neural code relying on temporal spike
	patterns distributed across large neuronal populations. Here we report
	a range of computer simulations and theoretical considerations that
	were designed to explore the possibilities of one such code and its
	relevance for visual processing. In a unified framework where the
	relation between stimulus saliencyand spike relative timing plays
	the central role, we describe how the ventral stream of the visual
	system could process natural input scenes and extract meaningful
	information, both rapidlyand reliably. The first wave of spikes generated
	in the retina in response to a visual stimulation carries information
	explicitlyin its spatio-temporal structure: the most salient information
	is represented by the first spikes over the population. This spike
	wave, propagating through a hierarchyof visual areas, is regenerated
	at each processing stage, where its temporal structure can be modified
	by(i) the selectivityof the cortical neurons, (ii) lateral interactions
	and (iii) top-down attentional influences from higher order cortical
	areas. The resulting model could account for the remarkable efficiencyand
	rapidityof processing observed in the primate visual system.},

	Comments on the ease of using the visual field expander as well as

	a see-through head-mounted display and a simultaneous minified view
	of a wide field presented as contour information. Here we create
	and evaluate multiple implementations of the augmented-view concept
	and report responses from potential users. Methods. Several prototypes
	using commercial off-the-shelf devices were implemented. Then they
	were evaluated in real environments in daylight and at night by two
	retinitis pigmentosa patients. Results. Effective expansion of the
	visual field of patients was achieved. Patients indicated their preferences
	for different properties, devices, and combinations. Conclusions.
	Patients found the augmented-view concept of help for their impairment,
	but wanted much more ergonomic design than the prototypes provided.
	Benefits, limitations, and possible improvements for the evaluated
	devices are discussed.},

	and select an edge detector parametric setup when real-world images
	are considered. In this paper, we propose a statistical objective
	performance analysis and detector parameter selection, using detection
	results produced by different detector parameters. Using the correspondence
	between the different detection results, an estimated best edge map,
	utilized as an estimated ground truth (EGT), is obtained. This is
	done using both a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis
	and a Chi-square test, and considers the trade off between information
	andnoisiness in the detection results. The best edge detector parameter
	set (PS) is then
	
	selected by the same statistical approach, using the EGT. Results
	are demonstrated for several edge detection techniques, and compared
	to published subjective evaluation results. The method developed
	here suggests a general tool to assist in practical implementations
	of parametric edge detectors where an automatic process is required.},

	of non linear images, and more generally of non-linear signals, valued
	in a bounded intensity range. The purpose of this paper is to introduce
	a new mathematical LIP model focused on theoretical and practical
	aspects concerning the enhancement of the transmitted medical images
	and the physical absorption/transmission laws expressed within LIP
	mathematical framework. First of all the bounded interval (-1,1)
	is considered as the set of gray levels and we define two operations:
	addition <+> and real scalar multiplication <x>. With these operations,
	the set of gray levels becomes a real vector space. Then, defining
	the scalar product (.|.) and the norm || .|| , we obtain an Euclidean
	space of the gray levels. Secondly, we extend these operations and
	functions for color images. Finally, the experimental results, shown
	as enhanced medical images, reveal that this method has wide potential
	areas of impact which may include: Digital X ray, Digital Mammography,
	Computer Tomography Scans, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imagery and
	Telemedicine Applications.},
